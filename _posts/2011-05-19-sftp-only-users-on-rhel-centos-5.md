title: Setting up SFTP-only users on RHEL/CentOS 5
---

Introduction
------------

Normally, when a user account is created on a Unix system, the user in question can log into the system via `ssh`, forward ports and use the SFTP subsystem if it is enabled in server configuration. However, at some point, a sysadmin might face the need to create SFTP-only accounts for a number of users. 

A naÃ¯ve approach would involve creating a new user and setting his or her shell to `/sbin/nologin`. This solution, nevertheless, has two annoying downsides, which might ruin the security of the system, if the users are not trusted enough.

The first one is that the users would still be able to forward ports if this is globally enabled for the trusted user accounts (which includes `sshd` acting as a SOCKS proxy) and the second one is that the users would be able to lurk around the root file system, which is certainly cannot be considered as an advantage when the users are not reliable enough.

In order to solve the first problem, one would need to apply certain configuration parameters to a specific subset of user accounts. The second issue can be avoided by instructing the SSH server to `chroot` into the user's directory upon successful login.

One can conveniently apply a bunch of configuration options to specific accounts using the `Match` directive available in the latest versions of the OpenSSH server:

    Match user badguy
        X11Forwarding no
        AllowTcpForwarding no
        ForceCommand internal-sftp

However, this directive is only included in OpenSSH 5.x and above, whereas Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 ships with OpenSSH 4.x. Therefore, an alternative approach will be outlined below.

In what concerns the chrooting, it can be achieved using the `ChrootDirectory` directive. Thankfully, corresponding patches have been backported to OpenSSH 4.x by Red Hat engineers. 

Strictly speaking, it unnecessary to build a proper chroot for SFTP-only users, since OpenSSH includes a built-in SFTP implementation that does not depend upon any external libraries, but if one wants the users to be politely rejected when they try to connect via plain `ssh`, one could just make `/sbin/nologin` work and that is it.

Implementation
--------------

### Setting up a parallel SFTP-only `sshd` instance

Since `Match` directive is unavailable and the installation of extra unsupported software is to be avoided at all costs, one can bring up a parallel SFTP-only `sshd` instance. The proper way to go would be, of course, to create an extra RPM, i.e. openssh-sftp which installs an additional `init` script and symlinks, but for an one-time deployment this might be an overkill.

First, let us create an `init` script, which is a straightforward modification of the stock `init` script supplied by Red Hat:

    root@box # cat > /etc/rc.d/init.d/sshd-sftponly
    #!/bin/bash
    #
    # Init file for SFTP-only OpenSSH server daemon
    #
    # chkconfig: 2345 55 25
    # description: SFTP-only OpenSSH server daemon
    #
    # processname: sshd-sftponly
    # config: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key
    # config: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub
    # config: /etc/ssh/ssh_random_seed
    # config: /etc/ssh/sshd_config-sftponly
    # pidfile: /var/run/sshd-sftponly.pid
    
    # source function library
    . /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions
    
    RETVAL=0
    prog="sshd-sftponly"
    
    # Some functions to make the below more readable
    SSHD=/usr/sbin/sshd-sftponly
    PID_FILE=/var/run/sshd-sftponly.pid
    
    # ZYV
    LOCK_FILE=/var/lock/subsys/sshd-sftponly
    OPTIONS=" -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config-sftponly "
    
    runlevel=$(set -- $(runlevel); eval "echo \$$#" )
    
    start()
    {
        cp -af /etc/localtime /var/empty/sshd/etc
    
        echo -n $"Starting $prog: "
        $SSHD $OPTIONS && success || failure
        RETVAL=$?
        [ "$RETVAL" = 0 ] && touch $LOCK_FILE
        echo
    }
    
    stop()
    {
        echo -n $"Stopping $prog: "
        if [ -n "`pidfileofproc $SSHD`" ] ; then
            killproc $SSHD
        else
            failure $"Stopping $prog"
        fi
        RETVAL=$?
        # if we are in halt or reboot runlevel kill all running sessions
        # so the TCP connections are closed cleanly
        if [ "x$runlevel" = x0 -o "x$runlevel" = x6 ] ; then
            killall $prog 2>/dev/null
        fi
        [ "$RETVAL" = 0 ] && rm -f $LOCK_FILE
        echo
    }
    
    reload()
    {
        echo -n $"Reloading $prog: "
        if [ -n "`pidfileofproc $SSHD`" ] ; then
            killproc $SSHD -HUP
        else
            failure $"Reloading $prog"
        fi
        RETVAL=$?
        echo
    }
    
    case "$1" in
        start)
            start
            ;;
        stop)
            stop
            ;;
        restart)
            stop
            start
            ;;
        reload)
            reload
            ;;
        condrestart)
            if [ -f $LOCK_FILE ] ; then
                stop
                # avoid race
                sleep 3
                start
            fi
            ;;
        status)
            status -p $PID_FILE openssh-daemon
            RETVAL=$?
            ;;
        *)
            echo $"Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart|reload|condrestart|status}"
            RETVAL=1
    esac
    exit $RETVAL
    
    CTRL+D

The configuration file would look as follows (not all directives are necessary, take into account the defaults of the distribution in use):

    root@box # cat > /etc/ssh/sshd_config-sftponly
    # ZYV
    PasswordAuthentication no
    PermitRootLogin no
    PidFile /var/run/sshd-sftponly.pid
    Port 2234
    Protocol 2
    UsePAM no
    
    Subsystem       sftp    internal-sftp
    
    ChrootDirectory /srv/sftp
    AllowTcpForwarding no
    X11Forwarding no
    ForceCommand internal-sftp
    
    CTRL+D

Then, create a link to the `sshd` binary, register and start the service:

    root@box # ln -s /usr/sbin/sshd /usr/sbin/sshd-sftponly
    root@box # chkconfig --add sshd-sftponly
    root@box # service sshd-sftponly start

### Creating an SFTP-only user

The next task would be to create a group for SFTP-only users and the users themselves:

    root@box # groupadd sftponly
    root@box # useradd badguy -g sftponly -s /sbin/nologin -m -K UMASK=0022
    root@box # passwd badguy

Here `-g` specifies the main group, `-s` sets the shell, `-m` creates the home directory from a skeleton and `-K` overrides the default options with regards to `umask` (optional).

It is important to set a strong password to the user (which can be immediately discarded) even though the public key authentication is to be used, because otherwise the system would consider this account to be inactive.

Now it is necessary to set up the public key authentication:

    badguy@foo:~$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

    root@box # mkdir /home/badguy/.ssh/
    root@box # chmod 700 /home/badguy/.ssh/
    root@box # cat > /home/badguy/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ...
    CTRL+D
    
    root@box # chmod 600 /home/badguy/.ssh/authorized_keys

### Creating a proper chroot

In order to avoid potential privilege escalation, the chroot and all path components leading up to the chroot have to be owned and only writable by `root`. Additionally, it is necessary to hardlink the shell and some supporting libraries inside the chroot:

    root@box # mkdir -p /srv/sftp/{home,lib,sbin}
    root@box # mkdir /srv/sftp/home/badguy
    
    root@box # chown badguy:sftponly /srv/sftp/home/badguy
    
    root@box # ln /lib/ld-2.5.so /srv/sftp/lib
    root@box # ln /lib/ld-linux.so.2 /srv/sftp/lib
    root@box # ln /lib/libc-2.5.so /srv/sftp/lib
    root@box # ln /lib/libc.so.6 /srv/sftp/lib
    root@box # ln /sbin/nologin /srv/sftp/sbin

Luckily, the OpenSSH server will not allow to use a chroot with wrong permissions.

### Wrapping up

Now set up a new host entry and try it out:

    badguy@foo:~$ cat >> ~/.ssh/config
    
    Host box
      HostName box.com
      Compression yes
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
      Port 2234
      User badguy
    
    CTRL+D
    
    badguy@foo:~$ sftp box

Now all these amazing feats would be for nothing if one wouldn't tell the standard `sshd` daemon to deny connections for SFTP-only users and it would happily let them in:

    root@box # cat >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    
    # ZYV
    DenyGroups sftponly
    
    CTRL+D
    
    root@box # service sshd restart

Enjoy and if I have missed something in my setup please do let me know!
